## Fixed Issues & Improvements

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

#### Duplicate Scoreboard Entries
- **Problem**: User names were being duplicated in the scoreboard
- **Cause**: `addScore()` was being called multiple times:
  - Once in `gameOver()` method
  - Again in `submitName()` method  
  - Again in `skipName()` method
- **Solution**: Removed duplicate call from `gameOver()` method
- **Result**: Each game now adds only one entry to the scoreboard

#### Start Game Button Text
- **Problem**: Button showed "startGame" instead of proper text
- **Cause**: Missing translation key in language files
- **Solution**: Added `startGame` translation for all 6 languages
- **Result**: Button now shows proper text in all languages

### 🧹 Code Cleanup

#### Removed Redundant Files
- Deleted `src/` directory (TypeScript terminal version)
- Deleted `dist/` directory (compiled files)
- Deleted `tsconfig.json` (TypeScript config)
- Deleted demo HTML files
- Deleted `password-blocker.js` (unused)
- **Result**: Clean project structure with only web game files
